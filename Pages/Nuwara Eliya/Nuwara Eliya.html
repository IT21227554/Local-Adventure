			Horton plains national park
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			Horton Plains National Park is a protected area in the central highlands of Sri Lanka and is covered by
			montane grassland and cloud forest. This plateau at an altitude of 2,100–2,300 metres (6,900–7,500 ft) is
			rich in biodiversity and many species found here are endemic to the region. This region was designated a
			national park in 1988. It is also a popular tourist destination The Horton Plains are the headwaters of
			three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha
			Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains’ vegetation is
			grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri
			Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species
			not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains.

			Haunting World’s End – The windswept plateau and the only national park where scenery is more captivating
			and attractive than the wildlife in it lets guests experience a park like nowhere else. The park offers
			guests with an amazing view point where at one point the cliff falls away.

			Knuckles mountain range
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			The Knuckles Mountain Range lies in central Sri Lanka, in the Districts of Matale and Kandy. The range takes
			its name from a series of recumbent folds and peaks in the west of the massif which resemble the knuckles of
			clenched fist when viewed from certain locations in the Kandy District. Whilst this name was assigned by
			early British surveyors, the Sinhalese residents have traditionally referred to the area as Dumbara
			Kanduvetiya meaning Mist-laden Mountain Range.
			The higher montane area is often robed in thick layers of cloud. In addition to its aesthetic value, the
			range is of great scientific interest. It is a climatic microcosm of the rest of Sri Lanka as the conditions
			of all the climatic zones in the country are exhibited in the massif. At higher elevations there is a series
			of isolated cloud forests, harbouring a variety of flora and fauna.
			it is home to a significantly higher proportion of the country’s biodiversity. The isolated Knuckles range
			harbours several relict, endemic flora and fauna that are distinct from central massif. More than 34 percent
			of Sri Lanka’s endemic trees, shrubs, and herbs are only found in these forests.

			Kitulgala
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			Kitulgala is a small town in the west of Sri Lanka. A rain forestry area, which gets two monsoons each year,
			and is one of the wettest places in Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, it comes alive in the first three months of the
			year, especially in February, the driest month. The Academy Award-winning movie The Bridge on the River Kwai
			was filmed on the Kelani River near Kitulgala, although nothing remains now except the concrete foundations
			for the bridge Kitulgala is the base for white-water rafting in Sri Lanka.
			Large numbers of people make the excursion from Colombo at weekends to enjoy the beautiful scenery, play in
			the river, Jungle Walks, Adventurous water fall jumps/ slides, White Water Rafting and have an excellent
			rice and curry lunch at the local restaurants.This area has most of the rainforest bird species that are
			found at the World Biosphere Reserve at Sinharaja, although in lower numbers. However, the secondary forest
			and cultivation at Kitulgala is more open than the pristine woodlands of Sinharaja, and elusive endemic
			species like Sri Lanka Spurfowl, Green-billed Coucal and Spot-winged Thrush may be easier to see. So
			Kitulgala is a primary spot for bird watching enthusiasts.

			Adam’s peak
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			Adam’s Peak – Sri Pada or Samanalakanda, (Butterfly Mountain) is a 2,243 m (7,359 ft) tall conical mountain
			located in central Sri Lanka. It is well known for the Sri Pada, “sacred footprint” rock formation near the
			summit, which in Buddhist tradition is held to be the footprint of the Buddha, in Hindu tradition that of
			Shiva and in Islamic and Christian tradition that of Adam, or that of St. Thomas. Adam’s Peak is important
			as a watershed. The districts to the south and the east of Adam’s Peak yield precious stones—emeralds,
			rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and which earned for its ancient name of
			Ratnadvipa.
			The pilgrims season to Sri Pada traditionally starts on the full moon of December and ends on the full moon
			of April . Access to the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni,
			Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte & Malimboda. The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent via
			Hatton and descent via Ratnapura; although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of
			the other trails by approximately five kilometers.
