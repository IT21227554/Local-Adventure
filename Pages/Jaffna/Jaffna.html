		<p id="paragraph">
			Casuarina Beach is in Karainagar, Jaffna District, Sri Lanka, about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Jaffna. The
			Casuarina Beach in Karainagar is also called and written as Casoorina, Cashoorina and few other variants.
			This is considered to be the best beach in the Jaffna Peninsula with white sand.
			The beach got its name due to the casuarina trees along the beach.

			HOW TO GET THERE?...

			The journey to Casuarina Beach can be made by bus or private transport through northern districts lined with
			palmyrah trees, and homes with dried tobacco leaves resting on their outer walls. The final leg of your
			journey includes crossing the Palk Strait on the Karainagar Causeway to reach the peninsular island home of
			Casuarina Beach

			Jaffna fort
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			The majestic stronghold of our colonial north

			Originally built by the Portuguese in the 17th century, the Jaffna Fort is one of Sri Lanka’s last
			well-preserved colonial ramparts. Sprawled over the southeastern edge of the northern capital, the Jaffna
			Fort owes much of its grandeur to the Dutch who captured it from the Portuguese, and later expanded it into
			the landmark we see today. Following the departure of the Dutch, the British also used the Jaffna Fort as a
			stronghold until Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948. Today, the Jaffna Fort is a popular attraction for all
			visitors to the city, with open grounds and century-old walls that can be scaled upon as you take in the
			views of Jaffna around you.
			The city’s historical fort stands tall over its bordering lagoon, overlooking the Kayts Causeway leading up
			to the peninsular island of the same name. The Jaffna Fort is especially welcoming closer to sunset, when
			accompanied by a cool ocean breeze and pinkish-orange skies of northern Sri Lanka

			Keerimalai
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			Sacred landmarks shrouded in myth and legend
			Keerimalai translates to ‘mongoose hill’ in the regional vernacular of Tamil. This refers to the local
			legend of a sage cursed with a face likened to a mongoose, who was later cured upon immersing themselves in
			the healing waters of the Keerimalai Sacred Water Spring. Today, the spring remains popular among throngs of
			local men and boys who splash about in a picturesque ancient pond overlooking the sea. The bathing area for
			women is separate, and can be found behind the main pond structure.
			Just next door, is also the Keerimalai Naguleswaram Kovil – one of Sri Lanka’s sacred Pancha Ishwarams, or
			shrines dedicated to the Hindu god, Shiva, who is worshipped as the destroyer of evil. Dating back over
			thousands of years, it is said that the same cursed sage established this kovil in gratitude of the adjacent
			pond’s healing powers.

			HOW TO GET THERE?...
			Keerimalai sits at the top edge of Sri Lanka and can easily be coupled with a trip to Dambakola Patuna in
			one journey. The sacred water spring and Naguleswaram Kovil are also within walking distance of each other,
			giving you ample time to explore both attractions in all their glory.

			Nainativu (Nagadeepa)
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			The most sacred Buddhist site in our peninsular north
			Arguably one of the most visited of Jaffna’s islands, Nainativu, or Nagadeepa as it is referred to in
			Sinhala, holds an important place in Buddhist and Hindu histories. For the former, the Nagadeepa Purana
			Viharaya is worshipped as one of Sri Lanka’s holiest Buddhist sites where the Buddha was said to have once
			called upon two Naga kings in disagreement with each other. And for the latter, the Nagapooshani Amman
			Kovil, which is referred to in several ancient chronicles as one of 64 Shakthi Peethams located across South
			Asia – shrines dedicated to Shakthi, the Hindu goddess of power.

			HOW TO GET THERE?...
			Travellers to Nainativu must first hop across two islands on a journey to the Kurikkaduwan Jetty, located
			approximately one hour away. From here, you will embark on a crowded 15-minute ferry to either the Nagadeepa
			Purana Viharaya, or the Nagapooshani Amman Kovil. You may even choose to enter Nainativu from one, then walk
			or take a short tuk-tuk ride to the other when leaving, in order to experience both journeys in one go.
