			Polonnaruwa Vatadageya
		</h2>
		<p id="p Polonnaruwa Vatadageya">
			Polonnaruwa Vatadage is a well-preserved Vatadage in the famous Dalada Maluwa quadrangle of the ancient city
			of ruins, Polonnaruwa. Vatadages are typical Buddhist structures found in Sri Lanka. These are circular,
			constructed using stone and brick with intricate stone carvings and a wooden roof. They were built to
			protect stupas. Currently, there are ten Vatadages in Sri Lanka, and the most popular one is Polonnaruwa
			Vatadage.

			This structure is built in Buddulakara or bubble-shaped design and is the perfect example of a typical Sri
			Lankan Vatadage. The upper part of the structure has been destroyed; only the lower part remains. Many
			theories revolve around the construction of this monument, but most historians agree to the hypothesis that
			it was built by Parakramabahu I in the 12th century. The Vatadage was initially constructed to protect the
			tooth relic of Buddha and his ten commandments. Buddhists believe that Buddha’s left canine remained even
			after his cremation, and the country has preserved this relic as their prized possession. This tooth, which
			was the reason for the construction of Polonnaruwa Vatadage, is now placed in the Temple of Kandy.

			The Vatadage protects a small stupa of 8 inches. The structure has two platforms - an upper platform and a
			lower one. The lower platform is 120 feet in diameter and 4 feet in height, while the top platform is 80
			feet in diameter and 5 feet in height. The centre of the top platform has four Buddhist statues in dhyana
			mudra in sitting position. The four figures are 5 feet tall and face the four cardinal directions. This
			architecture makes the Vatadage a very typical one, with a charm of its own. The structure and its
			surroundings emit positivity and are extremely inviting for tourists.

			Nissanka Latha Mandapaya
		</h2>
		<p id="p  Nissanka Latha Mandapaya">

			Nissanka Latha Mandapaya is a unique structure located in Sri Lanka. This architectural marvel is one of
			it's kind for many reasons. Nissanka Latha Mandapaya is a unique structure located in Dalada Maluwa
			quadrangle of Polonnaruwa district in North Central Province, Sri Lanka. This architectural marvel is one of
			it's kind for many reasons. King Nissanka Latha built Nissanka Latha Mandapaya in the 20th century. The
			purpose of this construction was to recite and hear Buddhist scriptures. Mandapa is a word used for
			sheltered pillars. In the 20th century, mandapas were built inside houses and used for recitals during after
			death ceremonies, which is how the structure got its name. Nissanka Latha Mandapaya is a raised stone
			platform, with many small stone pillars and eight big granite ones, a stone fence and a small stupa. The
			granite pillars are 8.5 feet tall and surprisingly curved at three places. The top of the pillars has a
			carving of a blooming lotus, while the test of the columns denotes the structure of a stem. The middle of
			the platform is a small stupa, which is also made of stone. The upper part of the stupa has been ruined but
			was identified to be made of wood.This structure is unique to Sri Lanka. No other architectural composition
			has been able to look like the magnificent Nissanka Latha Mandapaya. Unsurprisingly, Sri Lanka considers
			this site as a treasure and protects it accordingly.

			Wasgamuwa National Park
		</h2>
		<p id="p Wasgamuwa National Park">
			Wasgamuwa is a national park situated in Matale & Polonnaruwa districts, bordering the Mahaweli River.
			Wasgamuwa is very popular for drastic and tallest wild elephants and birds. The best time to visit is the
			evening when elephants become more active and keep clam, less noisy since wild elephant may attack your
			jeep. Our visit to Wasgamuwa NP is superb. There are 3 wildlife bungalows inside the park and we stayed
			Wavulabe Wildlife Bungalow which is very nice place in the band of Mahaweli River. Bungalow keeper Sarath
			was very helpful person and his foods are tasty and superb. Our tracker is Dhanushka, he is very experience
			tracker. He saved us from unexpected elephant attack. But the Park Warden and the management is not that
			much great since we have to wait more than one hour to find a tracker and clear the entrance

			Danigala Rock

			views of the rock show a unique semi-circular shape of it. There have been news of UFO sightings and alien
			activities in this area which gives it the name “Alien Mountain”.There is a peculiar form of vegetation
			surrounding the Danigala Circular Rock which makes it suspicious for alien activity. The rock also has a
			temple and many caves in the surrounding area. One such cave consists of a large reclining Buddha statue
			which is similar to the one found at Pidurangala. This Buddha image made of brick and stucco is said to be
			38.9 feet in length but has been vandalized by treasure hunters.

			The rounded track on top of Danigala does not seem to be man-made. Locals believe of alien activity in this
			area due to the peculiar features of Danigala. Danigala is known in the names “Alien Mountain”, “Kandegama
			Rock” and “Star Gate of King Ravana”. It is believed to be one of the places where King Ravana landed his
			special aircraft, “Dandu Monara”.A total of 70 caves have been found in this area. These caves date as early
			as the 2nd century. The place is often accessed by wild elephants from the surrounding areas. Many
