			Star Fort
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			In 1640 the Dutch completed the main fort at Matara but found it to be vulnerable from attacks coming from
			land. In 1762 Singhalese forces backed by Kandyan Kingdom attacked and took control of the fort. In 1763 the
			Dutch regained control of the fort and that year commenced construction of another smaller fort on the east
			bank of the Nilwala River, in order to protect the main fort from attacks originating from the river.
			The Star Fort was built to a unique shape of a six pointed star with space for 12 large cannons to cover
			approaches from all directions. The glacis or outer wall is approximately 7.5 metres (25 ft) wide and is
			surrounded by a 6 metres (20 ft) wide and 3.1 metres (10 ft) deep moat. The rampart walls of the fort are
			constructed out of granite rock and coral, and are 14 feet (4.3 m) in width. The fort was built to hold a
			small garrison, food supplies and enough ammunition to withstand an attack before being re-inforced from the
			main fort. The fort also had a two prison cells and a 2.75 metres (9.0 ft) diameter well in its centre to
			supply water. The drainage system was internal and disposed of the water collected from the monsoon rains to
			the moat. The date of construction (1765) is embossed over the main gate with the Dutch East India Company
			insignia and the coat of arms of the governor flanked by two rampart lions. The entrance gate of the Star
			Fort, which is faced with coral, is also emblazoned "Redoute Van Eck 1763", commemorating the Dutch Governor
			of Ceylon, Lubbert Jan baron van Eck (1719 - 1765). The roof of the building originally was roofed with
			cadjan leaves, which were later replaced with clay tiles.
			The fort is said to be the last major defence post built by the Dutch but never had the chance to prove its
			effectiveness. In 1796 the fort was handed over to the British with the surrender of the Sri Lankan
			territory by the Dutch. The British used it as an administrative office and in 1965 it was used as a library
			until 1975 when it was acquired by the Department of Archeology.[1] The fort has subsequently been restored
			and currently houses a museum, which showcases the history of Matara

			Polhena Beach
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			Located not far from the city centre of Matara, the Polhena Beach offers the perfect atmosphere for a beach
			getaway, without the crowds of tourists, making it all the more exclusive to anyone who visits the sandy
			stretch. The beach is primarily known to be a place of solitude and peace, so as to induce that sense of
			calmness in the minds of the traveller. Even the waters are relatively calmer than that experienced in Galle
			and Weligama, because of the corals acting as a fence of sorts. Although popular as a picnic beach, there
			are a few water sports that you can engage in, namely swimming and snorkelling.

		<p id="paragraph">
			Paravi Duwa Temple is a Buddhist temple situated in Matara. It is a popular Buddhist temple as well as a

			steel bridge connects the island to the land on the other wide and devotees as well as tourists can easily
			access the temple. The sheer beauty of the temple attracts people of all faiths towards it. From Mirissa
			travel approximately 12.8 km along the Matara Road up to Matara and then turn to Beach Road to reach the

			Dondra Head Lighthouse
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			Considered to be one of the more iconic lighthouses in the entire island, the Dondra Head Lighthouse serves
			to be the islandâ€™s tallest lighthouse, standing at a height of 160 feet. As it is located in the
			southernmost tip of Sri Lanka, it also serves to be one of the more important lighthouses still in
			operation. The lighthouse consists of 7 floors, which can be accessed by the 196-step stairway, which can be
			quite strenuous to the legs if you are to take the journey to the top. The view from the top is simply
			breathtaking, as it is possible to even the Bulutota Mountain Range if you look north. However, keep in mind
			that access to the top is only granted through special permission from the authorities.
			Since the lighthouse was built in the year 1890, during the occupation of the British Empire, the raw
			materials of the structure were all imported from the British mainland, especially from the granite rock
			quarries of Scotland and Wales. Moreover, the lenses and light that is used to power the lighthouse can be
			traced to some of the finest makers during the reign of the British Empire. Thus, the lighthouse is also a
			great example of the colonial heritage that is very much alive in the southern coast of the island.
