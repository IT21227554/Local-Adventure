			Sri Maha bodhi
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is one of the most ancient trees which are living even today standing tall in the
			Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. The tree is believed to have sprouted from a cutting brought
			from Bodh Gaya in India, where Gautama Buddha had attained enlightenment. The tree is an authentic and
			living link to Gautama Buddha and is often respected as the oldest tree in history which has a recorded date
			of the plantation.

			This ancient Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree has been protected and cared for by many years by the ancient kings
			and queens as well as the Buddhist monks. Today the tree is surrounded by statues, water canals and golden
			fences which make the site even more holy and spiritual enhancing its natural beauty. Although the tree is
			sacred for the Buddhists, many people belonging to other religions also pay a visit to the tree to immerse
			themselves in the tranquil beauty and to get a sense of calm from their day to day life.

			Another prominent feature is the Prarthana Bo tree. Many devotees believe that this tree has the power to
			grant the wishes of every person who pays a visit to the complex. The Buddhists make many offerings and vow
			at this sacred fig tree till today. The Sri Maha Bodhi tree is the most sacred tree in Sri Lanka and is
			revered and respected by Buddhists in Sri Lanka and all over the world.

			There are sermon sessions organized every day, where the Buddhist devotees visit the premises of the tree.
			On this occasion, you will find the atmosphere filled with the fragrance of the incense sticks and the
			burning of the oil lamps. We recommend visiting the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in the morning when one can make the
			most of the visit by participating in the rituals and also witnessing the breathtaking sunrise over the
			city.

			Ruwanweliseya

		<p id="paragraph">
			The Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the largest stupas or dagobas, which is in the heart of the beautiful
			heritage city of Anuradhapura. This magnificent stupa was built by King Dutugamunu, who was hailed to be the
			hero of the island. The Ruwanweliseya stupa is also known as the Maha stupa and is one of the most adorned
			structures of the people of Sri Lanka.

			Today the Ruwanweliseya stupa stands tall with a height of 338 feet and a diameter of 951 ft. The stupa is
			surrounded by large paved courts and platforms which add to the beauty of the place.
			Initially, on the outer side of the boundary of the wall is a complete circle of elephants, made out of the
			brickwork. Till today, there are many renovations which have taken place from time
			which has made the Ruwanweliseya stupa is one of the most revered and influential areas of worship for the
			Buddhists in Anuradhapura.

			Jetavanaramaya

			Jetavanaramaya monastery is one of the largest monasteries in the heritage city of Anuradhapura in Sri
			Lanka. This magnificent structure was the third-largest structure in the ancient world. Legend has it that a
			part of Buddha’s sash or belt was tied and preserved here at the Jetavanaramaya monastery.

			The Jetavanaramaya stupa comes with a fascinating historical significance which depicts the differences
			going on between the two sects of Buddhism- Theravada and Mahayana sects of Buddhism. Today, the stupa is no
			longer the tallest, but is one of the largest in the world, with an area of over five hectares and housing
			over 10,000 monks.

			Isurumuniya
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">

			Sri Lanka's ancient capital city, Anuradhapura is home to relics, stupas and rocky hills that bring an aura
			of serenity. Isurumuniya is one of the granite, marble and stone structures located near Tissa Wewa, and
			this Buddhist temple boasts of architecture and sculptures that showcase the emancipation of the artists.

			The structure of Isurumuniya is a crossover between a temple and a fortress. It was erected as a dorm for
			500 kids and then evolved to becoming a temple owing to its sanctity. Ever since then, Isurumuniya nurtures
			young minds and leads them along the path of spirituality, wisdom and council. It shelters tourists and
			serves as an abode that facilitates religious teachings and discipline. The structure evokes decorum and the
			carvings on stone are beyond thought provoking. This divine structure comes to life with internationally
			acclaimed inscriptions of the Isurumuniya Lovers, Elephant Pond and The Royal Family

			Ritigala Forestry Monastery
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			Ritigala situated between Polonnaruwa and the old town of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka is a hilly forest and a
			place of Buddhist worship. The monastery is named after the 40m tall Ritigala trees in the mid slopes of the
			hill; this Buddhist monastery has inscriptions that date back to 1st century BC.

			The highest of the peaks in the Ritigala mountain range is the Ritigala Kanda that makes for an excellent
			trekking adventure. A journey through the stonework bordering the streams, dense forests consisting of
			medicinal herbs and trees, gardens and courtyards with beautiful landscaping leads its way to the temple.
			Legend has it that herb called “Sansevi” found near the crest, on consumption gives eternal life. It is also
			an ancient legend that these mountains once hosted Hanuman and Sita on their expedition from Sri Lanka to
			India. Like this, there is so much of history and archaeological study associated with Ritigala.

			The common characteristics of a Buddhist temple are Bodhi trees and stupas. Ritigala however, is a class
			apart. Monks in Ritigala don’t practise traditional Buddhism, their clothing (repaired rags and shrouds),
			detachment from the world and their sincere yearning for enlightenment is what makes this place all the more
			austere. The fact that the concept of worship in an off-beaten track existed in the 2nd-century minds speaks
			volumes of the calming effect that Ritigala has

			Mihintale
		</h2>
		<p id="paragraph">
			Ceylon, as it was formerly known rests on a beautiful landscape down south of India; hills, beaches, valleys
			and waterfalls adorn this country. One such ancient marvel is the hills of Mihintale located 12 km from
			Anuradhapura which are known for religion, monarchy, warfare and the underlying sense of scenic diversity.

			Mihintale in the Sinhalese language means Mahinda’s hill – a Buddhist monk in the 11th century. This city
			was declared a wildlife sanctuary more than 2,200 years ago, making it the oldest of shelters in the world.

			Buddhism saw its conception in Sri Lanka in the rocky hills of Mihintale when King Devanampiya Tissa met
			monk Mahinda on the hilltop. Ever since then the Sri Lankans have had a stronghold of Buddhist teachings
			which was later enriched by Islam and Hinduism. They comprise of the Sinhalese, Indian Tamils, Sri Lankan
			Tamils and the Muslims. Their lives revolve around religious beliefs, that makes Mihintale a city with
			significant architecture, tranquil stupas and sanctuaries. All in all, the people hold sentiments close to
			their hearts and a trip to Mihintale will speak immensely about their beliefs.
