			Portuguese, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. It is a
			historical, Archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years
			maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of
			Sri Lanka.
			The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sri
			Lankan government and many dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are looking at
			making this one of the modern wonders of the world. The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by
			the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria
			iv, for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European
			architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries.The Galle Fort, also known as
			the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal
			area Galle town. It has been since restored.

			strip of rolling site comprises of a series of ridges and valleys. More than 60% of the trees are endemic to
			Sinharaja Forest and many of them are considered rare. There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds but
			the reserve is also home to over 50% of Sri Lanka’s endemic species of butterflies & mammals and also many
			kinds of insects, reptiles and rare amphibians. This is one of the main reasons that UNESCO declared

			Sinharaja Forest was first recognized as being the only considerable patch of virgin tropical rain forest in
			the Island.
