					<h1> Nuwara Eliya</h1>

						Nuwara Eliya is surrounded by hills and tea plantations. Due to the fact that Nuwara Eliya
						enjoys spring-like weather throughout the year it became a favourite retreat of the British
						during colonial times. In April and May the town is crowded with Sri Lankans attending dressed
						in their finery for the Derby at the Turf Club; at other times of the year it’s much quieter,
						with apparently stray horses quietly. The town’s attractions include the golf course, trout
						streams, Victoria Park, and boating or fishing on Lake Gregory. Victoria Park is an attractive
						and well-used oasis. It is popular with birdwatchers at quieter times because of the good
						opportunities for seeing species, particularly the Indian blue robin, pied thrush or scaly
						thrush lurking in the denser undergrowth. The Kashmir flycatcher is another attractive bird
						species in the park. </p>

			<h1>Galle</h1>
			<p id="p-topic">
				Galle, formerly Point de Galle, port and city, Sri Lanka, situated on a large harbour on the island’s
				southern coast. Galle dates from the 13th century, possibly much earlier, but it became the island’s
				chief port during the period of Portuguese rule (1507–c. 1640). Under Dutch rule it was the island
				capital until 1656, when Colombo replaced it. The rise of Colombo’s port in the second half of the 19th
				century led to Galle’s decline, but congestion at Colombo has caused some shipping to be diverted to
				Galle. The city, 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Colombo, has good road and rail connections. A cement
				factory is in operation there. The historic section of the city, containing a fort and other
				colonial-era buildings, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. In December 2004 most of
				Galle was destroyed or heavily damaged by a large tsunami that had been triggered by a strong earthquake
				in the Indian Ocean near Indonesia.
